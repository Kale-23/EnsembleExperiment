# Example Speach with Participant

## Greeting and Introduction
- "Hello, are you here for an experiment?"
- "What is your name"

- "Perfect, sounds like you are here for this study, you can follow me to the room"
- "My name is ___ and I will be running the experiment today"
    - "This is ___ and ___, and they are also in the lab and will be around as well"

## Getting Into Lab/ Consent Form

- "Could I have you place all your electronic devices into do not disturb, and place them on this table including a smartwatch or anything that could contact you"

- "Today you will be doing an experiment having to do with visual perception in VR, before we get to the experiment, we need you to fill out the consent form. Read through it thoroughly, and if you have any questions don't be afraid to ask. Once you are done, just mark if you consent or not, and sign and date the bottom."

## Getting IPD

- "Awsome, one last thing before we start. I am going to need to take your interpupulary distance so the VR headset will be calibrated correctly. This is just the distance between your eyes."

- "Would you mind if I touched the bridge of your nose with the ruler to take your IPD?"

- "Could I have you look right next to my ear, and stare with your eyes open? Perfect, your IPD is ___"

## Starting Experiment

- "We are all ready to start the experiment. Are you righty or lefty? Cool, here is the start of the experiment, just fill out this information and press submit when you are all done. Remember to put the IPD that we just took in the correct spot."

- "Now Its time to put the headset on, you can sit right here and get comfortable. Before you put on the headset, I can show you the controls you will be using during the experiment. This is trigger button by your index finger, and this is the joystick by your thumb. These two are the windows and menu buttons. Try to avoid touching these two, but if you do and a menu pops up, or if a notification of low battery pops up, press it again and the menu will go away. And I am going to put this wrist strap on, and we are ready to put on the headset."

- "So I am going to slide this over your head and adjust it now. Let me know when the headset is tight and comfortable on your head. Now I am going to adjust the top, so let me know when it is comfortable, and the screen is clearest. Perfect, now I am going to reach under your right eye and adjust to the correct IPD that we measured earlier. Is everything comfortable and is the headset clear? Perfect, now again I just want to show what happens when you press the windows and menu button. This is what they look like, and if you ever see them, just press the button again to make them go away."

## Loading the Experiment/ Depth Trials

- "Alright, I will load you into the experiment now."

- "Look around, and you should see some words and a blue square with a line pointing out. Face the line, and sit directly over the square with your legs on either side of the line. Get comfortable because you will need to hold this position for the rest of the experiment minus a couple breaks."

- "This first part is going to be testing your ablility to detect depth within VR, it will be confusing at first, but there is plenty of time to practice so do not worry. Read the instructions, press the trigger, and it will be easier to understand after the first practice trial"

- "So as you just saw, 8 spheres and a dot in the middle popped up, and then went away. The dot in the middle is called a fixation point, and will always be the same distance away from you. You should focus on that throughout the experiment; try not to let your eyes wander from it when it flashes on screen. The 8 spheres can pop up closer to you than the fixation point, the same distance away from you as the point, or further away from you than the point. If they are closer, pull the joystick down and the word "infront" will pop up, if they are the same distance put the joystick to either side and the word "same" will pop up, and if they are farther put the joystick upward and the word "behind" will pop up. You can submit your answer by using the trigger button."

- "Let me know if you have any other questions, otherwise, you can go through the practice trials. Words will pop up one more time, and then the experimental trials will begin"

## Experiment Trials

- "So you made it through the depth test, now it is time for the experimental phase to begin. Read the instructions, and again it will be easier to understand after the first practice trial"

- "You will see that the first part with 8 spheres is the same, but this time you will be trying to accurately determine the average size of the 8 spheres instead of juding their distance. You should still focus on the fixation point during the trials. After these disappear, a new sphere will pop up in your view, and you should see it now. You can make the sphere larger by pushing the joystick upwards, and smaller by pushing it downwards. You should do your best to adjust this sphere to the average size of all the previous spheres. When the sphere is the size you like, you can submit your answer with the trigger button again."

- "Let me know if you have any questions, once you make it through the practice trials, you will see another set of words, and the real trials will begin. This part is a bit longer than the previous, but every 4-5 minutes you will be able to take a break, and overall it should be about 20-30 minutes total. Let me know if you want to take your headset off for a minute or two when you reach the breaks, otherwise, do your best and good luck!"

## During Breaks (if they take the headset off)

- "Alright, make sure to line yourself over the blue square with either leg on either side of the blue line, and have the red line directly in the middle of your vision. When you are ready, press the trigger button again, and the trials will continue"

## Finishing Experiment

- "Awesome, looks like you are all done. Let me come grab the controller and headset off of you. I will give you sona credit right after this, so within a couple minutes you should get an email or be able to see it in your account. Do you have any questions about the study?"

- "Thank you so much for doing our study, we really appreachiate your time. Don't forget to grab your stuff, and have a great day!"
